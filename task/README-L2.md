# Level 2 ‚Äî Sheets UI "Edit History" Implementation

## üìã Task Overview
Automate capturing edit history from Google Sheets cells D2 and D7 using Playwright to:
- Right-click on cells D2 and D7
- Access "Show edit history" menu
- Extract previous version text and timestamps
- Save results to `data/history.json`

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created

### 1. `l2-sheets-ui-edit-history.py` (Original Implementation)
- Basic Playwright automation for Google Sheets
- Attempts to find and right-click cells
- Extracts edit history content

### 2. `l2-sheets-ui-edit-history-improved.py` (Improved Version)
- Enhanced error handling and authentication support
- Manual interaction fallback when automation fails
- Better selectors and timing
- Screenshots for debugging

### 3. `l2-mock-history.py` (Mock Data Generator)
- Creates sample output in correct format
- Useful for testing and demonstration
- Shows expected JSON structure

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Run Improved Playwright Script
```bash
C:/code/phalanx-testing-/.venv/Scripts/python.exe task/l2-sheets-ui-edit-history-improved.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Opens Google Sheets in Chromium browser
2. Attempts automated right-click on D2 and D7
3. Falls back to manual interaction if needed
4. Extracts edit history content and timestamps
5. Saves results to `data/history.json`

### Option 2: Generate Mock Data
```bash
C:/code/phalanx-testing-/.venv/Scripts/python.exe task/l2-mock-history.py
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `data/history_mock.json` with expected structure
- Useful for testing downstream processes
- Shows the target output format

## üìä Expected Output Format

The script creates `data/history.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "content_prev": "Previous version text from D2",
  "timestamp_prev": "2 hours ago",
  "requirements_prev": "Previous requirements from D7", 
  "requirements_timestamp_prev": "1 day ago",
  "capture_date": "2025-09-19T14:42:52.566516",
  "method": "playwright_improved"
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Playwright Features Used:
- **Browser Automation**: Chromium launch with custom settings
- **Element Selection**: Multiple selector strategies for Google Sheets
- **User Interaction**: Right-click, menu navigation
- **Content Extraction**: Text and timestamp parsing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and debugging

### Challenges & Solutions:
1. **Google Sheets Dynamic UI**: Multiple selector strategies
2. **Authentication**: Manual sign-in support  
3. **Timing Issues**: Proper waits and timeouts
4. **Error Recovery**: Screenshots and manual fallback

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Authentication
- Google Sheets may require sign-in
- Script waits 30 seconds for manual authentication
- Keep browser open during this time

### Manual Interaction
- If automation fails, manual steps are required:
  1. Right-click on cell D2
  2. Select "Show edit history"
  3. Wait for script to extract content
  4. Repeat for cell D7

### Debugging
- Screenshots are saved for debugging:
  - `manual_interaction_D2.png`
  - `manual_interaction_D7.png`
  - `edit_history_dialog.png`
- Full page content saved to `full_page_content.txt`

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- JSON file contains both texts and timestamps
- Previous versions captured from D2 and D7
- Timestamps in readable format
- Error handling for edge cases

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Browser doesn't open**: Check Playwright installation
2. **Can't find cells**: Try manual interaction mode
3. **Authentication required**: Sign in manually when prompted
4. **Empty results**: Check screenshots and debug files

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Playwright installation
C:/code/phalanx-testing-/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m playwright --version

# Reinstall Playwright browsers if needed
C:/code/phalanx-testing-/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m playwright install
```

## üìà Next Steps

This implementation provides a foundation for:
- Automated Google Sheets interaction
- Edit history analysis
- Content versioning workflows
- UI testing patterns

The script can be extended to:
- Capture more cells
- Extract additional metadata
- Process multiple sheets
- Integrate with reporting systems
