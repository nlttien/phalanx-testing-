- [ ] **Firewall exceptions** for Chrome debugging port

## üîß Installation Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Clone repository to target machine
- [ ] Navigate to `task/` directory
- [ ] Run `setup-level2.bat` OR manual setup
- [ ] Verify Python virtual environment created
- [ ] Confirm all dependencies installed successfully

### Configuration
- [ ] Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
- [ ] Configure CDP_PORT (default: 9222)
- [ ] Set CHROME_PROFILE if needed
- [ ] Verify output directory permissions
- [ ] Test Chrome CDP launcher script

### Initial Testing
- [ ] Start Chrome with CDP: `start-chrome-cdp-simple.bat`
- [ ] Verify CDP connection: `curl http://localhost:9222/json/version`
- [ ] Navigate to target Google Sheets manually
- [ ] Login and verify access permissions
- [ ] Run test automation: `python l2-sheets-ui-edit-history.py`

## üß™ Functionality Testing

### Basic Workflow
- [ ] Script connects to CDP browser
- [ ] Navigates to Google Sheets successfully  
- [ ] Finds and uses name box for cell selection
- [ ] Selects cell D2 correctly
- [ ] Opens context menu (right-click or Shift+F10)
- [ ] Finds "Show edit history" option
- [ ] Extracts edit history data
- [ ] Repeats process for cell D7
- [ ] Saves data to JSON file

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Handles missing CDP browser gracefully
- [ ] Recovers from network timeouts
- [ ] Manages element selection failures
- [ ] Deals with permission denied errors
- [ ] Handles Google Sheets UI changes
- [ ] Manages context menu failures

### Output Validation
- [ ] JSON file created in correct location
- [ ] Data structure matches expected format
- [ ] Timestamps properly captured
- [ ] Content data accurately extracted
- [ ] Debug screenshots generated (if enabled)

## üîç Quality Assurance

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Script completes within reasonable time (< 5 minutes)
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
- [ ] No resource leaks or hanging processes
- [ ] Browser remains responsive during automation
- [ ] Multiple runs work consistently

### Reliability Testing  
- [ ] Success rate > 95% under normal conditions
- [ ] Graceful handling of temporary failures
- [ ] Proper cleanup on interruption (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] No leftover processes after completion
- [ ] Consistent behavior across runs

### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Empty cells (no edit history)
- [ ] Very long edit history content
- [ ] Special characters in content
- [ ] Different Google Sheets languages/locales
- [ ] Slow network conditions
- [ ] Multiple concurrent Chrome instances

## üöÄ Production Deployment  

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Browser data directory secured
- [ ] Credentials not hardcoded in scripts
- [ ] Output data properly protected
- [ ] Network connections over HTTPS
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs or screenshots

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Log files configured and accessible
- [ ] Success/failure tracking implemented  
- [ ] Performance metrics captured
- [ ] Error alerting configured (if needed)
- [ ] Backup strategy for output data

### Maintenance Planning
- [ ] Update procedure documented
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Dependency update schedule
- [ ] Chrome version compatibility verified
- [ ] Support contact information documented
